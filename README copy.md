# Unlocking Supply Chain Optimization for Fast Fashion Industry

## Problem Statement

The fashion industry—a global powerhouse—is valued at $1.7 trillion and employed over 300 million people across the globe in 2023. In just over a decade (from 2000 – 2014), apparel production doubled, driven by a surge in fast fashion trends, with the number of garments bought per person increasing by 60 per cent (McKinsey & Company, 2023). This expansion has put immense pressure on supply chains to meet the fast-changing demands of the market. 

In the fast fashion industry, supply chain efficiency is very essential to ensure the company’s competitiveness in the market, given rapid product turnover and fast-changing consumer demand. By optimizing supply chains, companies can reduce operational costs, enhance product availability, improve customer satisfaction, and unlock growth opportunities. 

Hence, this project aims to utilize the data analytics to unlock the actionable insights in order to optimize supply chain operations of the fast fashion. Specifically, the project will focus on:
- Inventory management
- Logistics and transportation
- Supplier performance
- Predictive analysis


## Data Source

The project will carry out this analysis using a synthetically generated dataset downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshbhatt02/fast-fashion-supply-chain), designed to reflect the complexity of real-world fast fashion supply chains. There are four csv files in the dataset which include the primary data file, product details, production cost, and warehouse shipping costs. 
- Primary data file contains information about products, warehouse, factory, quantity of products in stock and sold;
- Product detail file includes detailed information about products’ name, type, price and weight;
- Production cost contains manufacturing cost data; and
- Warehouse shipping costs contain data on shipping cost from various warehouses and factories.
